## Q2

Write 5 user stories for your social media system from in-class activity #1:

I did my social media very similarly to Instagram (just a note).

User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to be able to add friends, so I can keep up to date with what they are doing.
2. As a user, I want to comment on others' posts, so that I can give my insight on the topic or post.
3. As a user, I want to be able to log in, so that I can access my account more than one time.
4. As a user, I want to post temporary stories, so I can show smaller events or ideas I want to share with others.
5. As a user, I want access to an explore page, so I can find people or things I am interested in online.
